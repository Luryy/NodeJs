>This repository contains my studies about NodeJs, I hope to help your studies with those concepts.
>Check the instructions below to a better use and optimization of your learning 


## How to check this Repository

#### Checking folders
Each folder has a concept implementation. Everyone has it's own _README_ containing: 
* **Get Starting** - where you could see how to start and see the implementation works 
* **Reference** - Links that I used to learn the implementation and will be useful for you understanding. _I recommend to aways check a folder with the reference links opened in another tab._

#### Folders type

As you can see, this repository has 3 folders types:
* **00-name** - this type of folder has a NodeJs concept implementation - you could filter a concept that you are interested and check it.
* **module-name** - this type of folder has a NodeJs native module implementation - you could filter a native module that you are interested and check it.
* **release-0.0.0** - this type of folder has a NodeJs release new features test - you could filter a release that you are interested and check it.

## Getting Started

#### Clone
First clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Luryy/NodeJs.git
```

#### Using
Pick a folder that you ara interested
```
cd folder xxxx
```
Follow the repository README instruction to see it working
</br>

Suggestion: _After see the concept working, try to change the code to have a better understanding about the behaviour_

:warning: If your folder has a "_.tool-versions_" file, it's a [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf) node version configuration and contains the required version of node to the respective folder
